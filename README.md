## Description
   The Planetary Explorer is a 3D interactive game designed to engage students in exploring alien worlds, specifically exoplanets. This project was developed in response to the challenge of creating innovative and accessible educational materials about exoplanets, aimed at inspiring curiosity and expanding scientific knowledge among students from various backgrounds. 
  
  Players navigate through a simulated environment of Kepler-1649c, overcoming obstacles and challenges while collecting data to learn about the planet's unique properties. By combining entertainment with education, The Planetary Explorer seeks to make complex scientific concepts more approachable and engaging for learners of all ages.

  ### Game Story
  Set a hundred years in the future, an epidemic threatens to make Earth uninhabitable. Humanity must venture beyond the solar system to find a new home, starting with Kepler-1649c, where players simulate the planetâ€™s terrain, gravity, and environment, etc...
  
  ### Gameplay Mechanics
  Players will navigate through various challenges and obstacles, collecting pictures that reveal valuable data about the planet. The game features three stages, each providing players with tools to gather scientific information:
  
  - **Level 1**: Measure the radius of Kepler-1649c and compare it to Earth.
  - **Level 2**: Determine the distance between Kepler-1649c and its star.
  - **Level 3**: Measure the mass of Kepler-1649c.
  
  Upon completing these stages, players will acquire crucial data sourced from NASA, enhancing their understanding of exoplanetary science.
